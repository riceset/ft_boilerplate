# ft_boilerplate
A basic shell script that creates the basic structure for a 42 project.

## Getting started
First, clone this repository and `cd` into it:

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/riceset/ft_boilerplate; cd ft_boilerplate
```

Give the permissions to execute the file:

```zsh
chmod +x ft_boilerplate
```

Now, move the file to an empty folder to start a new project:

```zsh
mkdir push_swap
mv create.sh push_swap
./create.sh
```

It will create the folder structure and import some files:
```
.
├── includes
├── libraries
├── sources
│   └── main.c
└── Makefile
```
